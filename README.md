# Legal Domain Classifier

This project is an AI-based legal text classification system that analyzes a legal case description and predicts the relevant branch of law.

## Overview
In legal practice, identifying the correct branch of law is a crucial first step. This project aims to automate that process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## How It Works
- The user provides a textual description of a legal dispute.
- The text is preprocessed using NLP techniques.
- A trained machine learning model predicts the most relevant legal domain.

## Supported Legal Domains
- Criminal Law
- Civil Law
- Labor Law
- Commercial Law
- Administrative Law

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLP (Tokenization, Text Vectori
